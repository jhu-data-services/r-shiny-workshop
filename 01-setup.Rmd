# Setup {#intro}

Before we can get started you will need to ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.

To install the **Shiny** package ensure you are connected to the internet, then run:

```{r install-shiny}
install.packages("shiny")
```

If you are using RStudio (which is highly recommended for this tutorial) you can also install **Shiny** by selecting the `Packages` tab, then selecting the `Install button` and entering `Shiny` in the `Packages: (separate multiple with space or comma):` form field and pressing `install`.

```{r load-shiny}
library(shiny)
```
