# Introduction to R-Shiny

## Structure of a Shiny App
Shiny apps are run from a single script `app.R` that is made up of three parts:
* A user interface object: The user interface defines object controls how your Shiny app **looks**.
* A server function: The server function controls how your Shiny app **runs**.
* A `shinyApp` function: The `shinyApp` function **builds** your Shiny app.
